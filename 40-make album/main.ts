// question# 40:Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. 
//Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.


type Album = {
    artist: string;
    title: string;
    tracks?: number;
  };
  
  function make_album(artist_name: string, album_title: string, number_of_tracks?: number): Album {
    let album: Album = {
      artist: artist_name,
      title: album_title
    };
  
    if (number_of_tracks !== undefined) {
      album.tracks = number_of_tracks;
    }
  
    return album;
  }
  
  // Create three different albums
  const album1 = make_album('Taylor Swift', 'Fearless');
  const album2 = make_album('Adele', '21');
  const album3 = make_album('Ed Sheeran', 'Divide', 16);
  
  // Print each album to show the information stored correctly
  console.log(album1);
  console.log(album2);
  console.log(album3);
